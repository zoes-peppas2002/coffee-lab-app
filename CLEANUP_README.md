# Coffee Lab Web App Cleanup and Fix

This document outlines the steps taken to clean up the web app and fix the login issues.

## Issues Fixed

1. **Login Issues**
   - Fixed the `isPg` variable definition in `direct-auth.js` (was being used before it was defined)
   - Updated the test-login endpoint to use the `/api` prefix
   - Fixed the syntax error in `App.jsx` (extra closing brackets)
   - Updated the FallbackLoginForm to use the correct API URL for endpoints

2. **Duplicate Files**
   - Organized batch files for different purposes
   - Created a unified approach to fixing and deploying the application

## Batch Files Created

1. **fix-login-issue.bat**
   - Fixes the login issues by updating the necessary files

2. **run-fixed-app.bat**
   - Runs the application locally to test the changes

3. **prepare-for-render-deploy.bat**
   - Prepares the application for deployment to Render
   - Builds the frontend
   - Copies the frontend build to the backend
   - Updates the .env files

4. **deploy-to-render.bat**
   - Deploys the application to Render
   - Commits and pushes changes to GitHub
   - Triggers a deployment on Render

5. **fix-and-deploy-all.bat**
   - Runs all the above batch files in sequence
   - Fixes the login issues
   - Prepares for Render deployment
   - Deploys to Render

## How to Use

1. **To fix login issues only:**
   ```
   fix-login-issue.bat
   ```

2. **To run the fixed application locally:**
   ```
   run-fixed-app.bat
   ```

3. **To prepare for Render deployment:**
   ```
   prepare-for-render-deploy.bat
   ```

4. **To deploy to Render:**
   ```
   deploy-to-render.bat
   ```

5. **To fix and deploy all in one go:**
   ```
   fix-and-deploy-all.bat
   ```

## Login Credentials

For testing purposes, you can use the following hardcoded admin credentials:

- Email: zp@coffeelab.gr
- Password: Zoespeppas2025!

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check the console logs for errors
2. Ensure all dependencies are installed
3. Verify that the database connection is working
4. Check that the API endpoints are correctly configured
5. Ensure that the frontend is correctly built and copied to the backend
6. Verify that the .env files are correctly configured
7. Check that the GitHub repository is correctly set up
8. Verify that Render is correctly configured to deploy from GitHub
