# Coffee Lab Web Application Cleanup

This document outlines the cleanup process for the Coffee Lab web application, including fixing login issues and preparing for deployment to Render.

## Project Overview

The Coffee Lab web application is a quality control system for coffee shops. It allows:

- Administrators to manage users, stores, and checklist templates
- Area managers to create and view checklists
- Coffee specialists to view and complete checklists

## Issues Identified

1. **Duplicate Files**: The project contained duplicate files and scripts that needed to be cleaned up.
2. **Login Issues**: The login form was not working correctly, with 404 errors when trying to access API endpoints.
3. **Deployment Issues**: The application was not properly configured for deployment to Render.

## Cleanup Process

### 1. File Organization

- Removed duplicate files
- Organized batch files into logical categories
- Created documentation for all batch files

### 2. Login Fix

#### Backend Changes

- Fixed the `isPg` variable definition in direct-auth.js
- Added a `/test-login` endpoint to server.js
- Added an `/api/test-login` endpoint for compatibility

#### Frontend Changes

- Updated the FallbackLoginForm.jsx component to try multiple login endpoints
- Added detailed debug information to help troubleshoot login issues
- Updated the API URL handling to use the correct URL for API calls

### 3. Deployment Preparation

- Created scripts to prepare the application for deployment to Render
- Updated environment configuration files
- Created documentation for the deployment process

2. **deploy-to-render.bat**: Deploys the application to Render
3. **fix-and-deploy-all.bat**: Fixes the login issues, prepares for Render deployment, and deploys to Render

## Documentation Created

1. **BATCH_FILES_README.md**: Documentation of the batch files created
2. **changes-summary.md**: Summary of the changes made to fix the login issues
3. **render-deployment-guide.md**: Guide for deploying the application to Render
4. **CLEANUP_README.md**: This file, documenting the cleanup process

## How to Use

### Local Development

1. Set up the local environment:
   ```
   setup-local-environment.bat
   ```

2. Fix the login issues:

   ```

### Deployment to Render

1. Fix all issues and deploy in one go:
   ```
   fix-and-deploy-all.bat
   ```

   Or, step by step:

   a. Fix the login issues:
      ```
      fix-login-issue.bat
      ```

   b. Prepare for Render deployment:
      ```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check the console logs for errors
2. Verify that all dependencies are installed
3. Ensure the database connection is working
4. Check that the API endpoints are correctly configured
5. Verify that the frontend is correctly built and copied to the backend
6. Check that the .env files are correctly configured

## Conclusion

The Coffee Lab web application has been cleaned up and fixed. The login issues have been resolved, and the application is now ready for deployment to Render. The batch files and documentation created during this process should make it easy to maintain and deploy the application in the future.
