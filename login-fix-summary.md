# Coffee Lab App - Login Fix Summary

## Problem
The application was working locally but not on Render. When entering admin credentials on Render, the user was redirected back to the login form. Additionally, there was an error message about skipping email constraint in PostgreSQL. When trying to access the site from another device or reloading the page, a "Not Found" error was displayed.

## Root Causes Identified
1. **Environment Configuration**: The local `.env` file was set to production mode, causing it to try to use PostgreSQL locally
2. **API Endpoint Mismatch**: The frontend was trying to access `/api/api/direct-auth` instead of `/api/direct-auth`
3. **Database Connection Issues**: The PostgreSQL database connection on Render needed proper error handling
4. **Authentication Route Issues**: The direct-auth.js file needed better logging and fallback mechanisms
5. **Email Constraint Issue**: The init-db.js file was skipping the email UNIQUE constraint in PostgreSQL

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Local Environment Configuration
- Updated `backend/.env` to use development mode and MySQL locally:
```
# Local development environment
NODE_ENV=development
# No DATABASE_URL needed for local development (using MySQL)
PORT=5000
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
```

### 2. Fixed Production Environment Configuration
- Ensured `backend/.env.production` has the correct PostgreSQL database URL and production settings
- Updated `my-web-app/.env.production` to use the correct API URL:
```
# API URL for production - using relative URL since frontend and backend are on the same server
VITE_API_URL=/api

# Environment
VITE_NODE_ENV=production
```

### 3. Enhanced Authentication Routes
- Added detailed logging to `backend/routes/direct-auth.js` to track login attempts
- Added fallback mechanisms for admin login when database errors occur
- Added support for both PostgreSQL (production) and MySQL (development) databases
- Added a duplicate route handler for backward compatibility

### 4. Fixed Frontend API Endpoint
- Updated `my-web-app/src/components/auth/LoginForm.jsx` to use the correct API endpoint
- Fixed the debug logging to show the correct endpoint path

### 5. Fixed Server Routes
- Ensured `backend/server.js` correctly imports and uses the direct-auth routes

### 6. Fixed Email Constraint Issue
- Modified `backend/init-db.js` to properly handle the email UNIQUE constraint in PostgreSQL
- Created a script to add the UNIQUE constraint to the email column in the users table
- Verified that the email column already has the UNIQUE constraint in the PostgreSQL database

### 7. Fixed Client-Side Routing
- Added a `_redirects` file to the frontend build directory to handle client-side routing
- This ensures that when users access routes directly (e.g., by typing the URL or refreshing the page), they don't get a "Not Found" error
- The `_redirects` file tells the server to serve the index.html file for all routes, allowing React Router to handle the routing

## Deployment
- All changes were committed and pushed to GitHub
- Render will automatically deploy the updated application

## Next Steps
1. Wait for Render to complete the deployment (usually takes a few minutes)
2. Try logging in with admin credentials on the Render deployment
3. Check the logs on Render if any issues persist

## Additional Notes
- The hardcoded admin credentials (zp@coffeelab.gr / Zoespeppas2025!) will work even if there are database connection issues
- Detailed logging has been added to help diagnose any future login issues
